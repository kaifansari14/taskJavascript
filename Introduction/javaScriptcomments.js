            // JavaScript Comments
    // JavaScript comments are annotations in the code that are completely ignored by the compiler. For example,

// display "Programiz" to the screen 
console.log("programiz");
//Here, // display "Programiz" to the screen is a comment. As a result, it is ignored by the JavaScript engine.

            // Types of JavaScript Comments
    // In JavaScript, there are two ways to add comments to code:

1. // - Single-Line Comments
2. // /* */ - Multiline Comments
        //    Single Line Comments
// In JavaScript, any line that starts with // is a single-line comment. For example,

name = "Jack";

// display name on the console
console.log("Hello " + name);
 
// Here, // display name on the console is a single-line comment.

// Note: You can also use single-line comments like this:

name = "Jack";

console.log("Hello " + name);  // display name on the console
 
            //  Multiline Comments
   // In JavaScript, multiline comments allow you to add comments that can span more than one line. They start with /* and end with */. For example,

/* This is a multiline comment.
It can span several lines.
*/

let numberOfStudents = 50;
console.log(numberOfStudents);
