//Initialize Variables in JavaScript
       // We use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.

// declare variable num 

let num;

// assign 5 to num 
num = 5;
       // Here, 5 is assigned to the variable num 
        //You can also initialize variables during its declaration.
//Change the Value of Variables
    //The value of a variable may vary. Hence, the name variable.

    //Let's look at the example below to learn how to change the value of a variable:

// declare variable num1 and assign 5 to it 
let num1 = 5;

// declare variable num2 and assign 5 to it 
let num2 = 6;

// assign 5 to variable score 
let score = 5;
console.log(score); //5 

// change the value of scores to 3 
score = 3;
console.log(score); //3

// valid 
let message = "hello";
let _message = "hii";
let $message = "heyy";

// invalid 
// let 1message = "heyy wasap"; // this gives an error

            //JavaScript Constants
       // A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

//In JavaScript, we use the const keyword to create constants. For example 
// assign 5 to num 
const num3 = 5;
//Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.

// assign 5 to num 
const num5 = 5;

// assign 10 to num 
 num=10;
 console.log(num); // Error! constant cannot be changed
                //Always Initialize a Constant During Declaration
//If you do not initialize a constant at the time of declaration, it throws an error. For example,
// Error! Missing initializer in Const declaration 
// const x;

// Attempt to initalize constant after declaration 
x = 5;

console.log(x);
