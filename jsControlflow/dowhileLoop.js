      JavaScript while Loop

The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

The syntax of the while loop is:

while (condition) {
// boby of loop 
}

Here,
1. The while loop first evaluates the condition inside ( ).
2. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside { } is executed.
3. Then, the condition is evaluated again.
4. This process continues as long as the condition evaluates to true.
5. If the condition evaluates to false, the loop stops.

         // Example 1: Display Numbers From 1 to 3

// initialize variable i
let i = 1;

// loop runs until i is less than 4
while (i < 4) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}
/*
Here is how the above program works in each iteration of the loop:

Variable   |  Condition: i < 4|	    Action                          |
-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
i = 1	   |       true	     |  1 is printed. i is increased to 2.  |
i = 2	   |      true	     | 2 is printed. i is increased to 3.   |
i = 3	   |      true	     |3 is printed. i is increased to 4.    |
i = 4	   |      false      |he loop is terminated.                |

                    // Example 2: Sum of Only Positive Numbers

let Num = 0, sum = 0;

// loop as long as num is 0 or positive
while (Num >= 0) {

    // add all positive numbers
    sum += Num;

    // take input from the user
    Num = parseInt(prompt("0: "));
}

// last, display sum
console.log(`The sum is ${sum}`);

/* 
The above program prompts the user to enter a number.

Since JavaScript prompt() only takes inputs as string, parseInt() converts the input to a number.

As long as we enter positive numbers, the while loop adds them up and prompts us to enter more numbers.

So when we enter a negative number, the loop terminates.

Finally, we display the total sum of positive numbers.

                    // JavaScript do...while Loop
/*
The do...while loop executes a block of code once, then repeatedly executes it as long as the specified condition is true.

The syntax of the do...while loop is:

do {
   // body of loop 
} while (condition);
 Here
 1. The doâ€¦while loop executes the code inside { }.
 2. Then, it evaluates the condition inside ( ).
 3. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside { } is executed again.
 4. This process continues as long as the condition evaluates to true.
 5.  If the condition evaluates to false, the loop terminates.

// Here, the initial value of i is 3. Then, we used a do...while loop to iterate over the values of i. Here is how the loop works in each iteration:
